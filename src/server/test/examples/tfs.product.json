The link from Workitems to Check-ins makes it easier to track down the source of a defect and perform code reviews. The link from Workitems to Builds enables teams to measure progress in terms of working software and to identify problems sooner. Using the links from Workitems to Builds, the VersionOne BuildRun Report can help a Release Manager select an appropriate build for release and can be the starting point for release notes."
